; Title          : SARS.lisp
; Team           : Renat Khalikov
; Created on     : April 25, 2018
; Description    : Baseline Mastermind player that plays in tournaments.
;                  Based off of Baseline stragety #1.
;                  The system chooses a "secret code" and program tries to
;                  guess that code.
; Purpose        : baseline against which we can compare the performance of
;                  our more sophisticated strategy.
; Usage          : (play-tournament *Mastermind* 'SARS 'insert-colors 25)
; Build with     : (load (compile-file "/Users/renatkhalikov/Desktop/code/project/SARS.lisp"))

; Permutations( ) generates a list of all permutations of list colors in
; lexicographic order, based of stackoverflow question:
